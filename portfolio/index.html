            <h1>about me</h1>
            <p>A web developer and a graphic designer born and raised in Kenya’s ancient city, Mombasa. I am a great story teller by default and that’s a chronic disease I am suffering from. My career journey began in a funny style by sketching crazy imaginary logos and images using free hand method until the day I realized the power of Adobe Creative Suite as a tool box for creating digital professional vector logos, (raster images) picture optimization and other design products. As time flew, I developed great passion towards the field of graphic design and flexed my efforts to learn various Adobe Creative Suite packages; adobe illustrator, adobe Photoshop, adobe InDesign and adobe XD which are the pillars to graphic design. After being competent with graphic design, I discovered the connection and great relationship between graphic design and web design. For example; “for one to develop a quality responsive website, he/she can come up with high fidelity mock-ups or prototypes to act as a smooth guidance in the web development”.  Therefore, I adjusted my scope of study to web designing as well as UI/UX designing and later combined with my great coding skills in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and PYTHON to become a top notch web developer, my primary and collective title.</p>

I am also responsible for the behavior and visuals that run in the user browser so that the users can view and interact with a particular website they are visiting. With the continuing arrival of new smart phones, tablets and desktops, I usually ensure that my sites come up correctly in browsers across all devices of different screen sizes. As a developer, I am chiefly concerned with render time, by manipulating the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure that the site opens up quickly. Consequently, I provide clean code with pixel perfect design, make sure that the website works correctly across all devices and works/loads as fast as possible.</p>
